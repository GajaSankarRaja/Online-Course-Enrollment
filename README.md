# Online Course Enrollment System

This project is a web-based application developed using Django that allows students to enroll in courses for their current semester. It was created as part of a college academic project to simulate a real-world course registration system used in universities.

## What this project does

The application provides a simple interface for:

* Students to register and log in
* Viewing available semester-specific courses
* Enrolling in selected courses
* Admin management of course listings and student enrollments

## Key Features

* Student authentication (login and registration)
* Course listing filtered by semester
* Enroll and drop functionality
* Admin panel for managing courses and users
* Error handling for invalid enrollments (like duplicate enrollments)

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Django (Python)
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap for styling)
* **Database:** SQLite (default Django DB)
* **Authentication:** Django's built-in auth system

   ```

2. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and log in with the admin credentials

## Why this project matters

This project helped understand how real-time applications like college ERP systems workâ€”handling user sessions, managing data models, and building a clean user interface with Django. It can be extended further with features like payment integration, schedule conflict checks, or a waitlist system.
